EtherDFS changelog history

v0.9.4 [2023-06-23]:
 - incorporate bugfix from Mateusz Viste v0.8.3
 - removed custom __GETDS code that is not needed anymore with recent WCC
 - use printf to print messages, getmsg hack removed

v0.9.3.1 [2022-01-26]:
 - add code of __GETDS to the resident code. From October 2021 version of WCC, this
   function is called in the preamble of the interrupt routine.
 - "write to file" requests with length 0 are forwarded to the server, so they can 
   be used to truncate a file to the current file position by writing zero bytes.

v0.9.3 [2021-12-12]:
 - fallback to loading in conventional memory if not enough upper memory available
 - added options in Makefile to compile with either speed or space optimisation
 - improved performance and memory allocation 

v0.9.2 [2021-12-10]:
 - added support for loading the TSR high (/h)

v0.9.1 [2021-12-7]:
 - reduced resident footprint by placing resident data at the start of the memory map
 
v0.9.0 [2021-12-6]:
 - first version that do not allocate extra memory

v0.8.3 [2021-12-4]:
 - port to Open Watcom v2 under OSX

v0.8.2m [2020-06-03]:
 - reduced EtherDFS resident footprint

v0.8.2 [2018-02-03]:
 - support for lock/unlock operations (INT 2Fh,110Ah).

v0.8.1 [2017-04-16]:
 - EtherDFS frames are validated by a cksum (can be disabled with /n),
 - EDF5 frames announce their length to avoid troubles with Ethernet padding,
 - arguments can be passed in any order,
 - /q and /u can be used together.

v0.8 [2017-03-04]:
 - improved self-detection to avoid loading EtherDFS twice,
 - added unloading support (/u),
 - fixed a FindFirst regression (fixes usage under 4DOS),
 - fixed SETATTR action when using a non-FreeDOS attrib command,
 - implemented the 'Seek From End' call,
 - minor memory optimizations,
 - makes sure the redirector API is available before installing,
 - support for multiple drive mappings.

v0.7 [2017-02-11]:
 - MS-DOS compat: flagging newly mapped drive so MS-DOS doesn't ignore it,
 - fixed FindNext behavior so it's compatible with ATTRIB from MS-DOS,
 - implemented the "Special Open" call (used by COPY in MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.x),
 - increased timeout retries from 3 to 5 (more reliable on lossy networks),
 - fixed parsing of the MAC address provided on command-line,
 - minor speed optimizations.

v0.6 [2017-02-05]:
 - significantly reduced EtherDFS resident footprint (16K -> 7K),
 - fixed GETATTR (was returning garbage),
 - added support for 'CLOSE FILE', 'RENAME FILE' and 'SET ATTRIBS' actions.

v0.5 [2017-01-31]:
 - first public release.
