EtherDFS -- known bugs

Here I list the few things that I know are going south with EtherDFS.

==============================================================================

Displayed "total" and "available" disk space information is not correct.

You may notice that EtherDFS shows "total" and "available" disk space
information that is not exactly the same as what the drive on your server
shows. This is expected, and it is due to two causes:

1. EtherDFS limits the maximum disk space to slightly under 2 GiB, otherwise
   most versions of MS-DOS would be confused.

2. Even below 2 GiB, the amount of disk space won't always be exactly
   reported, because the method of disk space computation is likely to be
   different between DOS and your remote host's system. EtherDFS translates
   one into another, but there still will be minor differences where EtherDFS
   will show a few kilobytes less than expected.

In both cases, the limitation is purely cosmetic and doesn't have any impact
on the amount of data that can effectively be read from or written to the
remote drive.

==============================================================================

Copied files loose their timestamps.

When you copy a file to an EtherDFS drive, this file will loose its original
timestamp and appear as being created "now". This is not really an EtherDFS
bug, but rather a limitation of MS-DOS. I might work around this in some
future versions.

==============================================================================

The game "Heretic" doesn't start from an EtherDFS drive with RTSPKT

When the RTSPKT packet driver is used with a Realtek 8139 network card, the
game "Heretic" is unable to start when launched from within an EtherDFS drive.
Not sure whether this is due to a bug in EtherDFS, the RTSPKT driver or both.

==============================================================================

aPACK v1.00 (http://www.ibsensoftware.com/products_aPACK.html) doesn't write
to output-file if current directory is an EtherDFS dir.
